# Popcorn -React App



Popcorn is a React web application that allows you to search for movies and view detailed information about them. You can also add user ratings to your favorite movies and save them to your watched list, which is stored in the browser's local storage.

## Features

- Search for Movies: Popcorn uses the OMDB API to fetch movie data, allowing you to search for movies by title, actor, or genre.

- Movie Details: View detailed information about a movie, including its title, plot, release year, genre, director, and more.

- User Ratings: Add your own ratings to movies and keep track of your personal preferences.

- Watched List: Save movies to your watched list, which is stored in your browser's local storage. Your watched list will persist even if you close the application or refresh the page.
